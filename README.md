## Project Overview

CleanSwift is a web-based cleaning service management platform that allows users to book cleaning services, view available packages, manage appointments, and make payments online. It is designed to streamline booking and service allocation while ensuring efficient service management.

## Features

-   **User Registration and Authentication**: Allows customers and staff to create and access accounts.
-   **Service Management**: Displays various cleaning packages, such as basic and deep cleaning.
-   **Booking Management**: Enables customers to book services, choose dates, and add special instructions.
-   **Payment Processing**: Supports secure payment transactions.
-   **Cleaner Allocation**: Assigns cleaners based on booking schedules and availability.
-   **Feedback System**: Allows customers to rate and provide feedback on services received.

## Database Setup

The SQL commands to create the database and tables are provided in a file named `cleanswift.sql`, located in the repository. Follow the steps below to initialize the database in MySQL.

### Prerequisites

-   **MySQL**: Ensure MySQL is installed and running on your system.

### Initialization Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cleanswift.git
    cd cleanswift
    ```

2. **Log into MySQL**:

    ```bash
    mysql -u your_username -p
    ```

3. **Create the Database**:

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS cleanswift;
    USE cleanswift;
    ```

4. **Run the SQL Script**:

    - Execute the SQL file (`cleanswift.sql`) containing the table definitions:

    ```bash
    mysql -u your_username -p cleanswift < cleanswift.sql
    ```

    This command will create all necessary tables (`Customer`, `Cleaner`, `ServicePackage`, `Booking`, `Payment`, and `Feedback`) and set up the primary and foreign key constraints.

## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies for the project (e.g., Node.js, Express.js) if a backend is implemented.
2. Configure the application to connect to the `cleanswift` database.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete:

-   Register as a new user or log in to access available services.
-   Book a cleaning service, select your preferred package, and specify the desired date.
-   Make a payment and track the booking status.
-   Provide feedback and rate the services.
